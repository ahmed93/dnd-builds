# 🌱 Kai's Evolution Path

> **"Not merely one who speaks to nature, but one who becomes nature itself."**

---

## Circle of the Moon Specialization

Kai's path follows the ancient traditions of the Circle of the Moon, druids who forge powerful bonds with the essence of natural creatures. While she can hold her own in combat, her true strength lies in versatility and protection rather than direct confrontation.

The Circle of the Moon represents druids who have embraced the primal ferocity of nature—those who do not merely communicate with the wild, but embody it in its most powerful forms. For Kai, this means becoming a versatile guardian capable of adapting to any threat while supporting her allies.
