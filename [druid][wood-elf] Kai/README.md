## 📜 Sacred Journey

> ✧ ✧ The Tale of Kai ✧ ✧

Born beneath the silver-veined canopy of **Hollow Glen**—an ancient woodland sanctuary that has outlasted empires—Kai's destiny was written in root and star. The glen stands protected not by walls but by ancestral whispers: rootbound wards, ancient oaths, and beasts that know no fear of steel.

Her childhood flowed with the rhythm of the forest:
> *"In dawn's first light, she learned the language of leaf and stem."*  
> *"When sun stood high, she ran with beasts who called her kin."*  
> *"As twilight fell, she sat at the feet of those who remembered the world's first song."*

She communed with animals before people. When she first felt pain, it was not her own—it was the blight creeping through roots, the unnatural stillness in birdsong.

### The Awakening

At 80 years of age, while her kin lingered in elven adolescence, Kai was accepted into the **Order of the Hollow Moon**, walking both arcane and natural paths. Where others mastered sword or arrow, she learned storm and soil. 

Her talents blossomed:
* **The Herbmaster's Gift** — Brewing clarity into golden tea that revealed forgotten memories
* **The Beast-Speaker's Tongue** — Calming raging beasts with voice alone, even those maddened by dark magic
* **The Runeweaver's Touch** — Speaking truths with leaves and ancient runes that could bind oaths to the very earth

She became renowned as a **keeper of balance and secrets**—one who could charm a wyvern or brew potions that recovered memories lost to time.

> "When she walks, the Old Forest remembers its first dream."  
> — Elder Sylvanir of the Whispering Council

## 🧠 Personal Quest

In recent decades, Kai has sensed a growing wrongness in the world. The signs are subtle but unmistakable:
* Beasts grow restless without cause
* Storms gather from directionless skies
* Trees bleed amber that poisons the earth

The elders name it a **"shadow without form"**—a corruption whose origin remains unknown.

Kai has volunteered to leave her sanctuary—not from rebellion, but from **duty**. The Glen has protected her for over a century; now she will protect it in return.

She journeys as the Glen's silent envoy, seeking the source of this corruption:
* Forgotten magic awakening in ruins
* Ancient oaths broken in darkness
* Or something older still, stirring beneath the world

She walks with ancient eyes and a belt full of herbs, scrolls, and secrets. She listens more than she speaks—but when she does, nature itself seems to listen back.

## 💔 Mortal Limitations

* Naive to human politics and courtly intrigue
* Speaks with unfiltered directness that can offend
* Tends to withdraw into isolation when overwhelmed
* Bears deep guilt for not leaving the Glen sooner
* Places the wellbeing of animals and nature above humans and other races

---

> *She is the whisper between branches, the stillness before storms, and the memory of stars in forgotten places.*
