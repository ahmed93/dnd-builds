## Appearance & Presence

Kai moves with the grace of a wind-stirred branch. Her presence is calm, but beneath her eyes lingers something older than words. Beasts part for her. Trees lean. She is not just druid—she is _known_ in the wild.

## Backstory

Kai was born beneath the silver-veined canopy of **Hollow Glen**, an ancient and hidden woodland sanctuary that has outlasted empires. The glen was protected not by walls, but by whispers—rootbound wards, ancestral oaths, and beasts that knew no fear of steel. From her first breath, Kai was touched by the balance of wildness and wonder.

Her early years passed in rhythm with the forest: mornings steeped in ritual, afternoons chasing shadowed trails with a panther companion, and nights wrapped in the voices of elders who spoke in a tongue older than stars. She spoke with animals before she spoke with people. And when she first felt pain, it wasn’t hers—it was the blight in the roots, the stillness in the birdsong.

At the age of 80, while others lingered in elven adolescence, Kai was accepted into the **Order of the Hollow Moon**, a sect that walked both arcane and natural paths. Her kin learned sword or arrow—Kai learned storm and soil. She brewed clarity into tea, calmed beasts with voice alone, and spoke truths with leaves and runes.

She became known as a **keeper of balance and secrets**. She could charm a wyvern or brew a draught that brought memory back from fog. She did not boast—_the wild does not waste words_.

## Reason for Traveling

Over the decades, Kai noticed something wrong. Beasts grew restless. Storms came from directionless skies. Trees bled amber that poisoned earth. The elders named it a **“shadow without form.”**

Kai volunteered to leave—not from rebellion, but **duty**. The Glen had kept her. Now she would protect it in return.

She travels now as the Glen’s silent envoy, seeking the source of this corruption: forgotten magic, broken oaths, or something older still. She walks the world with ancient eyes and a belt full of herbs, scrolls, and secrets. She listens more than she speaks—but when she does, nature listens back.
