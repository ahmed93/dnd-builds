## 🌿 Presence & Appearance

Kai moves with the grace of a wind-stirred branch, her footsteps leaving no trace upon the forest floor. Her eyes—deep as ancient pools—carry wisdom beyond her years. There is a calm to her presence that makes even the wildest beasts part before her path, and trees seem to lean toward her as she passes.

She is not merely a druid who studies nature; she is *recognized* by the wild itself. The forest whispers her name in rustling leaves, and storms pause at her lifted hand.

## 📜 Sacred Journey

Born beneath the silver-veined canopy of **Hollow Glen**—an ancient woodland sanctuary that has outlasted empires—Kai's destiny was written in root and star. The glen stands protected not by walls but by ancestral whispers: rootbound wards, ancient oaths, and beasts that know no fear of steel.

Her childhood flowed with the rhythm of the forest:
* Mornings steeped in ritual and meditation
* Afternoons spent along shadowed trails with her panther companion
* Evenings wrapped in the stories of elders who spoke in tongues older than stars

She communed with animals before people. When she first felt pain, it was not her own—it was the blight creeping through roots, the unnatural stillness in birdsong.

At 80 years of age, while her kin lingered in elven adolescence, Kai was accepted into the **Order of the Hollow Moon**, walking both arcane and natural paths. Where others mastered sword or arrow, she learned storm and soil. Her talents blossomed:
* Brewing clarity into golden tea
* Calming raging beasts with voice alone
* Speaking truths with leaves and ancient runes

She became renowned as a **keeper of balance and secrets**—one who could charm a wyvern or brew potions that recovered memories lost to time.

## 🧠 Personal Quest

In recent decades, Kai has sensed a growing wrongness in the world. The signs are subtle but unmistakable:
* Beasts grow restless without cause
* Storms gather from directionless skies
* Trees bleed amber that poisons the earth

The elders name it a **"shadow without form"**—a corruption whose origin remains unknown.

Kai has volunteered to leave her sanctuary—not from rebellion, but from **duty**. The Glen has protected her for over a century; now she will protect it in return.

She journeys as the Glen's silent envoy, seeking the source of this corruption:
* Forgotten magic awakening in ruins
* Ancient oaths broken in darkness
* Or something older still, stirring beneath the world

She walks with ancient eyes and a belt full of herbs, scrolls, and secrets. She listens more than she speaks—but when she does, nature itself seems to listen back.

## 💔 Mortal Limitations

* Naive to human politics and courtly intrigue
* Speaks with unfiltered directness that can offend
* Tends to withdraw into isolation when overwhelmed
* Bears deep guilt for not leaving the Glen sooner
* Places the wellbeing of animals and nature above humans and other races

---

> *She is the whisper between branches, the stillness before storms, and the memory of stars in forgotten places.*
